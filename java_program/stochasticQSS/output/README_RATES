To plot ReacLib rates in gnuplot:

1.  In the directory containing StochasticElements.java, execute

    java ElementMaker | tee temp.txt

2.  In the resulting interface click "Select Isotopes" choose a network setup 
and corresponding rates.

3.  Click the "Plot Rates" button, which gives a window with a list of 
reactions.  NOTE:  In the java plotting you can select and deselect reactions 
and subreactions in this window.  This selection has no effect for the output 
gnuplot data files. All reactions and no subreactions from the original list
are output to the gnuplot data files.

4.  Click "Plot" in that window. This invokes

a.  Output through the stream toGnuRates2 in PlotParams.java to the data file 
output/gnuplotRates2.data of data to make rates plots using gnuplot_rates2.gnu.

b.  Output of the Reaclib parameters P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7 for rate 
calculations to the file output/gnuplotRates.data (nothing presently being done 
with this file).
